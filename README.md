# Java-Lexical-Analyzer
King AbdulAziz Universality - Compiler Construction (CPCS-302)

## Overview

The main goal of this project is to develop a lexical analyzer that can:
- Identify lexemes and tokens from the source code.
- Truncate white spaces and comments from the source code.
- Differentiate between identifiers and reserved words.
- Generate an error after encountering some illegal characters.

## Features

- **Lexeme Identification:** Extract lexemes and categorize them into tokens.
- **Whitespace and Comment Handling:** Ignore whitespaces and both single and multiline comments effectively.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling to manage illegal characters or malformed input.
